# Text_Clustering_Analysis-

Project Title- Text Clustering Analysis 

Description- This project uses nltk processing to analyze five books of
different authors and genre, train a machine learning algorithm and test the
algorithm by trying to predict which book a group of words come from.

This code was written in Python 3.7 and requires
1. Python Integrated development Environment
2. The source code "Text_Clustering_Kmeans.ipynb"

Libraries needed for this code
1.  nltk
2.  Statistics
3.  Matplotlib
4.  Random
5.  Sklearn
6.  String
7.  Pandas
8.  Numpy
9.  Itertools
10. OS
11. codecs
12. logging
13. Seaborn
14. Collections

The code has being broken into different cells to represent different steps.
Run each cell separately
